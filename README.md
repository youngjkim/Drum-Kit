# Drum Kit

Drum Kit is a simple Javascript project that I've created to practice HTML DOM

## Installation

Simply download the source code and open the HTML file in your browser.

You can either use your keyboard to play the drum sounds according to the letters listed for each button.

OR you can simply click on each image to play the sound.
